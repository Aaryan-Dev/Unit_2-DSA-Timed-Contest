// You are given a square matrix of size n. Rows are indexed 1 to n from top to bottom and columns are indexed 1 to n form left to right. Matrix consists of only '*' and '.'. You need to check whether matrix is symmetric or not. if it is, check it is symmetric about vertical axis or horizontal axis or both.

// A matrix is said to be symmetric about horizontal axis if 1st row is identical to n-th row, 2nd is identical to (n-1)th row and so on.

// A matrix is said to be symmetric about vertical axis if 1ST column is identical to nth column, 2nd identical to (n-1)th and so on for all columns.

// Note : You don't have to take the input. 
// Just complete the function and print the required output




//Hint use line++;

function checkForSymmetry(n, matrix) {
    //write code here
    //console n,matrix and check the input response
}
